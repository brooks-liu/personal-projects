This is a single player strategy game (maybe I can make it multiplayer in the future) that involves having cities and connections between cities represented by nodes and edges respectively.

The mechanics of the game are simple. Each city will have a number above it, indicating the number of troops in the city. Players will move certain amounts of troops to different cities in hopes of capturing them or defending them from attack.

Players will start with a capital that produces troops at a certain rate, and each conquered city (by sending troops and defeating the troops in the city) will also produce troops.

Players will defeat other players by capturing their captial (and I might make different game modes in the future).

Cities with different functions like protected cities, technology cities, population cities, and other places like coal mines, power plants, ocean bases, will give different buffs. These buffs may range from full army buffs (like increased move speed between cities and boosted "morale" - the ratio between how troop casualties on either side are counted) to city buffs (like increased population growth or increased defense) to buffs that can be relocated (like commander buffs).

A full list of controls will be listed here when the game is fully functional.

Key notes for now:
I have not decided on whether there will be any random chance in this game
This will be a game against bots on a (hopefully) randomly generated map
