- got board working for mux
- figured out how to use Quartus and the De1-SoC file for the mux
- wrote "fpga-notes.txt" to help workflow in the future

- wrote a vga module: "vga-test.sv"
- had trouble testing: 
    - added "output logic VGA_HS," for VGA_HS, VGA_VS, VGA_R, VGA_G, VGA_B
    - kept getting "VGA_B" is not a bus or array warnings
    - ended with a "one or more pins are missing I/O standard assignments" error
- need to look into how to map the wires correctly to have the VGA signals connected to the board
