i type these during work sessions usually so if i speak in weird present/past tense combined thats why lol

09/25
- got board working for mux
- figured out how to use Quartus and the De1-SoC file for the mux
- wrote "fpga-notes.txt" to help workflow in the future


09/27
- wrote a vga module: "vga-test.sv"
- had trouble testing: 
    - added "output logic VGA_HS," for VGA_HS, VGA_VS, VGA_R, VGA_G, VGA_B
    - kept getting "VGA_B" is not a bus or array warnings
    - ended with a "one or more pins are missing I/O standard assignments" error
- need to look into how to map the wires correctly to have the VGA signals connected to the board

09/29
- got past the error (still a lot of warnings... 15 for the timing analyzer, 145 for the full compilation)
- .sof file creates and runs on the board but output not correct
- somethings still wrong bc once i run it on the board the screen entered power saving mode
    - tbh tho could just have been a coincidence but it literally went power save the moment i clicked start
    - nvm i ran it again and it does turn off the moment i click start
    - apparently this indicates a rejection of the signal so will do some editing on the signals
- only 100 warnings now, and no timing analyzer warnings!
- made a couple edits, notably decreasing the clock speed from 50 to 25MHz, and also changing the vga to blue screen
- i realized that i can probably test somethings on modelsim, hopefully will get the vga working tomorrow! 

09/30
- got an idea of what to do for game logic, got started on the actual game
- have some new ideas for what to do to get vga working
- how am i going to get a proper input into the vga?

10/01
- i wonder if the left to right, top to the bottom format for the board will work properly? maybe dividing it into individual lines?
- worked on a rate divider to convert the clock to the ticker (its in library currently "rate-divider.sv")

10/02
- tested vga display on modelsim, corrected some small mistakes (not initializing values) but still not working
- switched clock to VGA_clock instead of CLOCK_50, got rid of divider
- looking at pin planner found out that i need a VGA_BLANK_N signal (1 means on, 0 means off) for my board so implementing right now
- checked errors from terminal (maybe i shouldve checked before this) and saw i didnt capitalize VGA in VGA_HS/VGA_VS when instantiating
- got a different error on the display - before it used to be "going to sleep"
    - now its "The current timing is not supported by the monitor display. Please change your input timing to 1920x1080, 60Hz or any other
    monitor listed timing as per the monitor specifications"
    - does this mean i need to change the resets to 1920 and 1080?
        - No

    - might need to adjust signals to not be on for the porchs
- going to start testing in modelsim first just to confirm everything has a signal
- still no luck gotta go to my midterm now
- will update to have localparams

10/04
- Looking into common errors for vga displays
- Possible errors/fixes:
    - Might look into using measuring devices (oscilloscopes?) if I can to measure the signals
        - I might have access to a logic probe
    - Researched some specifications about the FPGA board
        - Altera board might be limited in memory (~500k bits)
            - From the user manual: "4,450 Kbits embedded memory"
        - Could try using "mega pixels"
    - Clock might(?) be at smth like 25.125MHz instead of 25 (i dont think this is that likely)
