- got board working for mux
- figured out how to use Quartus and the De1-SoC file for the mux
- wrote "fpga-notes.txt" to help workflow in the future


09/27
- wrote a vga module: "vga-test.sv"
- had trouble testing: 
    - added "output logic VGA_HS," for VGA_HS, VGA_VS, VGA_R, VGA_G, VGA_B
    - kept getting "VGA_B" is not a bus or array warnings
    - ended with a "one or more pins are missing I/O standard assignments" error
- need to look into how to map the wires correctly to have the VGA signals connected to the board

09/29
- got past the error (still a lot of warnings... 15 for the timing analyzer, 145 for the full compilation)
- .sof file creates and runs on the board but output not correct
- somethings still wrong bc once i run it on the board the screen entered power saving mode
    - tbh tho could just have been a coincidence but it literally went power save the moment i clicked start
    - nvm i ran it again and it does turn off the moment i click start
    - apparently this indicates a rejection of the signal so will do some editing on the signals
- only 100 warnings now, and no timing analyzer warnings!
- made a couple edits, notably decreasing the clock speed from 50 to 25MHz, and also changing the vga to blue screen
- i realized that i can probably test somethings on modelsim, hopefully will get the vga working tomorrow!
