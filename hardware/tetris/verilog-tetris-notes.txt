Tetris rules: 
- https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline
- 10x20 board
- Pieces are I, O, T, S, Z, J, L
- Score counter


Needed Parts:
- Score counter --> use 7 seg display
- Display system
- Pieces + rotation (either direction)
- Gravity
- Speed up? maybe
- Connection to VGA

Basic Plan:
- Get VGA working for a demo first
- Game logic:
    - Represent game board (10x20)
    - Map pixels to cells
    - Important signals (start, reset, pause/stop)
    - Represent a tile on the board as full or empty
    - Tetromino pieces representation
    - Rotation of pieces
    - FSM (spawn at top, move down each tick, check collision, lock piece, check and clear row, repeat for next piece)


Possible Future Additions:
- There's some fancy moves where you can spin your piece even when youre touching another piece
- Score tracker and use this to speed up tick speed
- Display which piece is next
- Option to store a piece / swap with the piece in storage
- Game over screen
