Verilog Project Ideas (note that I'm assuming difficulty level):

- Simulate a traffic light - simple
- Score tracker on 7 seg display - simple
- VGA display driver (with like tetris or smth) - hard
- Something related to making debugging easier
- Construct a better CPU (and be able to run code in assembly on it) - hard
- Write a new library for something verilog (or a microcontroller or something)
- Write a driver for a sensor/chip
