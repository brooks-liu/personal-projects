ModelSim:
- file --> open then choose the proper directory
- can also use cd <directory> until you get there
- do <filename>.do to test (obviously write your test file first)
- in the do files, include which verilog file + module you're testing
  - vlib work
  - vlog mux.sv
  - vsim mux
  - log (/\*)
  - add wave (/\*)


Quartus + Lab FPGAs (see mux-demo.mp4 for PROOF that it works):
- Open project --> the de1-soc folder thats uploaded --> open qpf file
- open the de1soc_top.sv file
- make sure the boards turned on, then go to Tools-->Programmer
- use hardware set up to get to the de-soc [usb-1]
- Auto Detect and choose 5csema5
- double click "none" next to the 5csema5 chip and choose the .sof file (need to create sof file first)
- hit "Start"
- now should be working (after it hits 100% successful)


Create .sof file:
- Put the .sv file for whatever module you want to instantiate into the de1soc folder
- Open the .qpf file 
- Go to Project-->Add/Remove Files in Project--> ...--> add the proper file and hit ok
- Instantiate the module you want in de1soc_top.sv
- Hit "Start Compilation" (takes a while)
- .sof should be created in an "output" folder
