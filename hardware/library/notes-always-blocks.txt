always_ff (flip flop)
- sequential logic (happening on clock edge)
- signal clock edge (with maybe async reset)
- use <= to assign
- good for state registers + counters

always_comb
- combinational logic (no clock)
- good for next state logic (FSM) + cases + muxes + ALUs (arithmetic logic unit, should be in this library)
