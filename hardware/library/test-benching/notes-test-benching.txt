General Notes:
- some syntax is a lot like c (the for loop)
    - looked into this and a lot of the syntax was meant to be similar to c
    - meant to be easier for ppl to transfer from C to verilog
    - things like comments, operators, blocks, semicolons etc.
    - while and for loops also exist in verilog
        - while is not synthesizable
        - for doesn't really do anything except maybe rarely for more concise code
- general path is stimulus --> DUT --> output checker
- instantiate like in normal system verilog
- DUT (Design Under Test) --> the specific part under test (individual components of a bigger design)
- DUV (Design Under Verification)  --> entire system under test, probably including many individual DUTs

Initial / Forever 
- initial blocks are sequential within one block, but run in parallel with other initial blocks
    - only execute once at the beginning of the simulation
- forever loops good for if want a periodic signal, also must have a time delay in the loop to advance
- forever block wont execute unless its in a procedural block like initial/always


System Tasks
- $display("Input: %h, Output %h", x, y)  similar to printf in C. h specifies hexadecimal, stuff like %b, %d, %s exists too
    - runs once when called
- $monitor("%d", variables) will print if any of the signals specified changes
    - doesnt need to be called again to print smth new, will run whenever smth changes
- $time used a little differently, used like a variable to get the current simulation time
    - $display("%t", $time)
- $finish finishes the simulation

Errors:
- "clk is not a valid l-value in main, clk is declared here as a wire"
    - basically i wrote clk <= inside the initial block, which is wrong because it is not a continuous assignment
    - same with reset, forgot to initialize declaring them as logic
    - also i declared input/output ports but realized theres no input/outputs for main, so initialize the clk, reset, and 
    
- when i include $finish or $stop it doesnt work?
    - kept giving "syntax error" at the "end" declaration of the initial block, then when i delete that it says syntax error at 
    "endmodule" at the end of the module, then when i delete that it says "syntax error" on the empty line
    - couldnt figure out the issue, so just ran using for loop or if i used forever i just specify run time in ModelSim

For ModelSim:
- file --> new --> project
- name the project
- add all files
- in the command line type in order:
    - vlib work (mightve already been created)
    - vlog <DUT>.sv  (add the DUT files first then testbench)
    - vlog main.sv  (assuming testbench name is main)
Can skip to here if already uploaded files
    - vsim work.main
    - add wave {/*}  (adds all waves, if the waveform window isnt open go to view --> wave)
    - run or run <time>ns
    - wave zoom full

Future topics to look into:
- Output checker (besides manual checking using the console output)
- Using .do to run the testbench
