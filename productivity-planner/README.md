# productivity-planner

This will serve as my dream tool for all my productivity needs.

Are you tired of terrible functionality in your productivity apps? What about a lack of features? Too many apps to think about and nothing syncs together? Well search no more! Ok yea I'm done the infomercial.

I want to get all of the functions that I want to see in productivity apps, while also keeping the good parts of some. Hopefully this will be a full functioning thing with at least one feature sometime soon but I do want to finish my personal website first before using that to build this (probably) web application.
