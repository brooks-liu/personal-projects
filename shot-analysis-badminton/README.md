The general idea of this project is to use object detection to analyze the number of each type of badminton shot that is taken in a video, and then present this data to the user. The goal of this project to to provide another analysis tool to badminton players and coaches to quantify their performance. Further features could include a shot quality metric, shot selection quality measurement, and tips for improvement. Another possible extension of this project is to create software that can help adjust footwork, swing, and racquet position for beginners.
