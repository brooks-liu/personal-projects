GitHub Notes:

Git is a version control system, (tracks changes to files, like checkpoints)
- Allows reverting to a previous version
- Can work in teams, copy to a local repository, and then upload/download the changes to/from the remote repository (GitHub and others like it)

Git is the actual control system
GitHub desktop runs git as a desktop app (with a nicer interface compared to the command line)


Essentially, create a folder in the GitHub Desktop folder (probably in user/documents) and you'll be able to access the repository in the app
When you make changes to something, it is automatically detected
To commit, enter a message and hit commit to the branch that you want
You can then push these changes to github, or fetch changes before you push yours

Branches can be used to make edits at the same time as others, and you can merge the branch with main to update the code without breaking anything
To merge, go to main branch, then go to the "branch" option and "merge into current branch" and select the branch you want

To make changes and send a pull request instead (needs approval to be saved onto github):
- commit onto branch
- publish the branch to github
- create pull request on github
- others can merge the pull request after approval
