GitHub Notes:

Git is a version control system, (tracks changes to files, like checkpoints)
- Allows reverting to a previous version
- Can work in teams, copy to a local repository, and then upload/download the changes to/from the remote repository (GitHub and others like it)

Git is the actual control system
GitHub desktop runs git as a desktop app (with a nicer interface compared to the command line)
